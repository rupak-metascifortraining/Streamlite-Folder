**Descriptive Statistics**

1.What is the purpose of descriptive statistics?

  Descriptive statistics help us make sense of data by summarizing it in a clear and simple way. Instead of looking at a huge list of numbers, we can use things like averages, percentages, or charts to understand what’s going on—like how typical something is, how spread out the values are, or if there are any patterns. It's basically about turning raw data into something easy to understand at a glance.

2.Can you explain the difference between mean, median, and mode?

  Mean is what most people call the average. You add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are. It gives a general idea of where the center of the data is.

  Example: For 2, 4, 6 → Mean = (2+4+6)/3 = 4

  Median is the middle value when the numbers are in order. If there's an odd number of values, it's the middle one; if even, it's the average of the two middle ones. It’s great when you want to ignore really high or low outliers.

  Example: For 1, 3, 100 → Median = 3

  Mode is the number that shows up most often. A set can have no mode, one mode, or more than one (that’s called bimodal or multimodal).

  Example: For 2, 2, 3, 4 → Mode

3.How do you interpret the standard deviation of a dataset?

  Standard deviation measures how much the values in a dataset differ from the average. A low standard deviation means the values are close to the average, while a high standard deviation means the values are more spread out. It gives you a sense of how consistent or varied the data is.

4.Describe the concept of skewness in statistics.

  Skewness in statistics refers to the measure of asymmetry in the distribution of data values around the mean. It indicates whether the data is symmetrically distributed, skewed to the left (negative skew), or skewed to the right (positive skew).

  Types of Skewness: a.Symmetrical Distribution (Zero Skewness):

  The left and right sides of the distribution are mirror images.

  Mean ≈ Median ≈ Mode.

  b.Positive Skew (Right Skewed):

  The tail on the right side is longer or fatter than the left.

  Mean > Median > Mode.

  Example: Income distribution in many countries.

  c.Negative Skew (Left Skewed):

  The tail on the left side is longer or fatter than the right.

  Mean < Median < Mode.

  Example: Age at retirement (most retire around a specific age, few retire much earlier).

  Why Skewness Matters: It helps in understanding the shape of the data distribution.

  It affects many statistical techniques, especially those assuming normal distribution (like regression or t-tests).

**Inferential Statistics**

5.What is the main goal of inferential statistics?

  a.Estimate population parameters (like the mean or proportion) using sample data.

  b.Test hypotheses to determine if observed patterns are statistically significant.

  c.Make predictions about future outcomes or unseen data.

  d.Determine relationships between variables using models (like regression).

6.Explain the difference between a population and a sample.

  The difference between a population and a sample lies in scope and size:

  Population: The entire group of individuals, items, or data you're interested in studying.
  It includes every possible observation of a particular kind.

  Example: All college students in India, every product made by a factory in a year.

  Sample: A subset of the population, selected for analysis.
  It should be representative of the population to draw accurate conclusions.

  Example: 500 students randomly selected from colleges across India.

7.What is a confidence interval, and how is it useful in inferential statistics?

  A confidence interval (CI) is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter (like the mean or proportion) with a certain level of confidence.

  Key Elements of a Confidence Interval: Point Estimate: The best single estimate of the population parameter (e.g., sample mean).

  Margin of Error: Accounts for variability and uncertainty in the sample.

  Confidence Level: Indicates how sure we are (usually 90%, 95%, or 99%) that the interval contains the true parameter.

  Example: If we calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average height of students to be [160 cm, 170 cm], it means:

  We are 95% confident that the true average height of all students falls between 160 cm and 170 cm.

8.Define p-value.

The p-value is the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

The p-value is the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
